Project to rate NFL kickers adjusting for difficulty of kicks they are asked to make

Next steps:
-Factor in weather
	-Game data indicating time of game
	-Map home team to city
	-Need list of nuetral site or international games. Game location will be different than home team's stadium
	-Need list of domed stadiums as well as teams that have changed stadiums recently
	-Research weather API's
-Look for data set that contains info on left-to-right kick location
-Think about stadium effect (certain stadiums such as Denver may be easier to kick in). Big challenge is that this will be highly correlated with kicker, as kickers will play in their home stadium much more than others. Wonder if factoring in weather (and altitude) would suffice
